# Redux-based Invoice Management System

An Invoice management project built with React and Redux that allows users to create new Invoices. On top of that, you can view, edit and delete the saved invoices in the Redux Store by dispatching various actions on the state defined in the reducer.

The Invoices can be downloaded as PDFs. Uses [jspdf-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jspdf-react) to capture the data from the modal and covert it from canvas -> pdf.
